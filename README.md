# React Hooks Tasks App

This application belongs to the set of tutorials made with [React](https://es.reactjs.org/).

This application shows how to use React's **useState** and **useEffect** Hooks. In addition to the use of **localStorage** to save non-sensitive data in the browser.

The application shows a series of tasks previously saved in localStorage. These can be marked as done or not done and displayed in different tables. It also allows you the possibility of adding new tasks.

We use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library to style the application.
